# ScienceMD

ScienceMD is a portable, self-contained Markdown editor designed for scientific and technical writing. It combines Markdown editing, rendered preview, WYSIWYG-style editing, LaTeX mathematics, image embedding, document styles, undo/redo, and print/PDF support in a single HTML file.

## Current application

The complete web application is stored in [`index.html`](./index.html). Download that one file and open it in a modern browser; no installation or web server is required.

The hosted version is available through [GitHub Pages](https://coolkama.github.io/ScienceMD/).

## Highlights

- Single-file, offline HTML application
- Markdown and visual editing
- Undo and redo
- Inline and display LaTeX mathematics
- Live rendered preview
- Embedded images
- Science-paper document styling
- Print and PDF output
- Desktop and mobile layouts
- Local `.md` file open/save support where the platform permits it
- Native Android wrapper and APK build workflows
- Embedded ScienceMD icon

## Running ScienceMD in a browser

1. Download `index.html`.
2. Optionally rename it to `ScienceMD.html`.
3. Open it in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, or another modern browser.

All required application code and libraries are embedded in the HTML file.

## Android app

The Android project is stored in [`android`](./android). It packages the same self-contained `index.html` application in a native WebView wrapper with Android `.md` file selection and printing support.

Every push affecting the application or Android wrapper runs smoke checks, Android lint and a debug APK build. Proper signed releases are produced manually through the **Release Android APK** GitHub Actions workflow after the repository signing secrets have been configured.

See [`android/RELEASING.md`](./android/RELEASING.md) for the one-time signing setup and release procedure.

.github/workflows/release-android-apk.yml Signed GitHub Release workflow
README.md                               Project information
```

## Development

ScienceMD deliberately keeps the distributed application self-contained. Changes should be tested on both desktop and mobile-sized browser windows, including Markdown editing, visual editing, undo/redo, mathematics rendering, file loading, saving, printing and preview synchronisation.

Run the repository smoke checks with:

```bash
python3 tools/smoke_test.py
```

## Status

ScienceMD is under active development. The repository contains the latest working single-file web build and the Android wrapper used to produce installable APKs.
